# AVM: Agent View Model Design Pattern

**AVM (Agent View Model)** is a software design pattern that separates the representation of information (the "View Model") from the user interface (the "View"). This separation enables modular, maintainable, and testable code, and is especially useful for building scalable applications and AI agents.

This pattern makes it easier to manage complex projects, test business logic independently, and adapt the UI to different platforms or technologies.

## Features
- Promotes separation of concerns and modularity
- Improves testability and maintainability
- Supports scalable and reusable architectures
- Ideal for AI agent and MCP Server implementations
